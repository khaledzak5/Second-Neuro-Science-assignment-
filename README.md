# Neural Network Backpropagation Example

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using PyTorch.  
The model is designed based on a common backpropagation example, with manually set weights and biases to match a typical step-by-step exercise.

## Files

- `backpropagation_example.py`: Python script that builds the neural network and performs a manual backpropagation step.
- `backpropagation_example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the script for easier testing and running on Google Colab.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python backpropagation_example.py
    ```

3. Or open the notebook directly on Google Colab to execute step by step:
